Jade Dragon Snow Mountain (simplified Chinese: 玉龙雪山) is a mountain massif or small mountain range in Yulong Naxi Autonomous County, Lijiang, in Yunnan province, China. Most of Yunnan Province is a plateau terrain, this snow mountain altitude is 4680m, so each time I move at the top of the mountain need to rest a while to avoid plateau reaction.
