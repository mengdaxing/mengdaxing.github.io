I am currently a master's student at NCUT, majoring in computer science. My research interests include deep learning, spatio-temporal big data analysis, smart grid technologies, and data pre-processing. These topics reflect my passion for exploring the intersection of computer science and real-world applications, with a focus on developing practical solutions for complex problems.
